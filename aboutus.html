      <h1> Our mission </h1>
   
      <p> We help graduate and young artists to establish their careers in the art industry. We sell all different mediums from paintings to pottery! StART offers our purchasers the opportunity to invest in the artists of the future.

We saw that too many young artists were struggling to sell their work when they were starting out, and thought that what they needed was a platform to help them showcase and sell their work for a reasonable price. </p>

<br>


<h1> The founders </h1>

<p>
Sam Kashia and Ellen Young both graduated from Central St Martins in 1999 with degrees in Fine Art. Sam became well known for her excellent pottery work and has had exhibitions all around the world, whilst Ellen moved into product design for a large advertising agency.
<br>

The two were remained best friends, and came up with the idea of StART in 2005. They thought that giving a platform to young artists would allow them to get on their feet much more quickly.

<h3> Sam </h3>
  <p> “I created StART since I knew from personal experience how hard it is to make a name for yourself when starting out as an artist.” </p>
<br>
  <h3> Ellen </h3>

   <p> “Seeing how my best friend struggled after university is what prompted me to suggest the idea of StART to her later in life.” </p>
